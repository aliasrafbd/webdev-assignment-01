                <p class="banner-description">I am Asraf Ali. I was trying to learn Web Design and Development from various platform. I have been trying to learn it from 2018 when I was having my B.Sc in CSE in Dhaka from a private university named BUBT. But I could not have it. I know Jhankar Mahbub vai from 2019-2020. When he launched Programming related course I was very excited. One day I will learn from Jhankar vai. I was busy for governement job preparation. For that reason I could not do it. Now I am doing a Govt. (Autonomou) job in Bangladesh (CTG). My company name is PGCB. Here, In office time, I got lots of free time. So I planned for having a skill. Therefore, I got admitted in 2024</p>
